Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, All three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) classified the breed of Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed, which is "german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian."

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, All three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) classified the breed of Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg to be the same breed, which is "german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian."


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes , all three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg as a cat and Object_Name_01.jpg as a coffee mug, indicating that both images were classified as not being dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All three model architectures achieved the same accuracy in classifying the dog breeds and distinguishing between dogs and non-dog images. However, ALEXNET had the shortest total elapsed runtime 0:0:2. If you prioritize speed and accuracy, ALEXNET would be the best model for uploaded image classification.
